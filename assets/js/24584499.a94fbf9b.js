ActionScript APIs that will be introduced in future beta releases of 33.1.\\nNote that using \u201c33.0\u201d as a namespace is not valid, and is resulting in behaviors such as VerifyErrors being\\ndispatched at application start-up with built-in class names such as ExtensionContext, Context3D, and others.\\n  \\n### 3.1.2 Build Tools  \\nXcode 13 and the latest macOS and iphoneOS SDKs are now being used to build the AIR SDK.\\nThe build system for this is on a version of macOS that doesn\u2019t support 32-bit processes hence we cannot\\ngenerate the 32-bit versions of the stub
